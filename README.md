# Neat Scripts

Collection of cool and/or useful scripts that I seldom use.

## Usage

> Note that these can only run in *nix environments (and maybe WSL, dunno).

To run the scripts, you have to clone this project and execute:

```bash
chmod +x <filename>           # Give executable permissions to the file
./<filename>                  # Run the script

mv <filename> /usr/local/bin/ # If you want to make it available system wide
```
