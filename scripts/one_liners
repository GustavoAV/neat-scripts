# LSB_RELEASE ALTERNATIVE
# In install tutorials, it's common to have "lsb_release -cs" to get the Distro codename like "jammy", "bullseye" or sth like this.
# However, in Linux Mint, this returns Mint's codename, for which most repositories don't contain specific versions.
# This command gets the relative Ubuntu version in which Mint is based.
codename=$(sed --quiet "s/UBUNTU_CODENAME=//p" /etc/os-release)
